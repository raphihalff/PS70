      <h3 class="highlight" id="design">Design</h3>
      <p>The idea for my kinetic sculpture was to narrate a poem by the Yiddish poet A. Lutzky, titled "A Piece of Paper Wants to Commit Suicide." It goes like this:</p>
      <pre>
        a piece of paper tired of life,
        found its way to some rails
        and waited for the train.
        		when the train steamed in
        the piece of paper  tre m ble d   at its might
        took a
        		leap
        and left with terrible joy
    </pre>
    <p>I envisioned a train approaching via a belt powered by a DC motor. The same motor would rotate gears and cams which were, in turn, connected by wires to a typewritten copy of the poem, causing it to flutter, dance, and toss itself in front of the belt-driven train. The cams would then cyclically return to their start position and the train would loop through a "tunnel" to reappear at its start position.</p>
