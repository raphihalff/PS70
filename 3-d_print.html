      <p>I wondered if it would be possible to print in place a box with sliding covers. I designed the following and printed a very small version as a test. It turned out, the joint tool I used to assemble the covers with the box body embedded the cover with the wall of the box. So, failure. I moved the sliding covers manually in Fusion to hover within the cover slots, expanded the gaps around the covers vertically and horizontally, and printed a slightly bigger version. After playing with the printed result, chisseling ever so slightly at the points of contact, the covers slid! Albeit with difficulty and without anything to grip the covers by. I used the drill press to make two guiding holes and then screwed in two tiny screw for knobs. Voila.</p>

      <p>I also scanned an acorn using Revopoint. I negelected to take a picture of the acorn itself before scanning, slicing and printing. So no comparison can be made for a quality evaluationâ€”the real acorn is  within the printed one. I had naively hoped the clear PLA would be clear.</p>
